              Hey! I&apos;m Ahmed, if you haven&apos;t already gathered that by
              now. I&apos;m a web developer and designer from Bologna,
              Italy. I specialize in the frontend development with such a love for the design technologies, primarily Figma, InVision, Angular, Vue and React, but
              love building with whatever tools are right for the job.
            </p>
          </Reveal>
          
          <Reveal>
            <p className={styles.aboutText}>
              Outside of work, I love to paint, play music and football. 
              Sometimes I read books that can inspire me!
            </p>
          </Reveal>
          <Reveal>
            <p className={styles.aboutText}>
              I&apos;m passively looking for new positions where I can merge my
              love for technology and design. If you think
              you&apos;ve got an opening that I might like, let&apos;s connect
              ðŸ”—
